**Summary**
The VizChitra conference planning meeting focused on CFP progress (22/60 proposals received, needing further outreach), keynote speaker selection (postponed until more proposals are received), and ticket pricing strategies (multiple models proposed, aiming for a 50/50 split between ticket sales and sponsorships, with simplified discount policies prioritizing automation).  Next steps include finalizing the CFP review process by April 15th, exploring a volunteer-driven childcare solution, and securing a venue and moderator for the Bangalore pre-event on April 25th.

**Detail**
	•	**Editorial Call for Proposals (CFP)** – Rasagy Sharma reported on the editorial CFP progress, noting 22 proposals received thus far, against a target of around 60. They detailed a plan to utilize a shared rubric for evaluation and leverage additional reviewers if needed. They also highlighted the need for additional outreach to potential speakers, suggesting leveraging the core team's networks and social media promotion.
	•	**Keynote Speaker Selection** – Discussion ensued regarding the selection of a keynote speaker. Zainab Bawa advised against a keynote speaker unless the individual is highly popular or the topic is exceptionally compelling, citing a negative experience from a previous conference. Rasagy Sharma proposed considering core team members for a keynote, but Zainab Bawa suggested direct communication with potential speakers instead of group discussion. They also suggested a wrap-up session as an alternative. The group ultimately decided to prioritize getting more proposals before finalizing a keynote decision (00:22:48).
	•	**CFP Promotion Strategies** – Zainab Bawa suggested maintaining warm relationships with previously contacted potential speakers, encouraging them to promote the CFP on their social media without committing to review duties.  Rasagy Sharma agreed, emphasizing the team’s need to complete a first review pass before seeking external reviewer assistance. They proposed utilizing the April 15th deadline as a key milestone for determining the need for further support.
	•	**Childcare Policy for VizChitra Conference** – Zainab Bawa raised the topic of establishing a policy regarding children at the conference. They suggested a volunteer-driven approach, providing activities and a designated space for childcare needs rather than a professional service. Rasagy Sharma expressed support for a volunteer-led childcare initiative, and the group agreed in principle to explore this further (00:28:31).
	•	**Ticket Pricing Strategies** - Amit Kapoor presented three pricing models for conference tickets, ranging from a low-end model starting at ₹2500 with four price bands to higher models starting at ₹4000 and a weekly incremental model.  Ipsa Jain suggested a combination of time-based and capacity-based pricing. Amit Kapoor presented cost estimations, highlighting the need to balance affordability with covering conference costs and emphasized the need to secure a significant portion of the budget through sponsorships.
	•	**Ticket Pricing Discussion and Decisions** – Discussion followed regarding the optimal ticket price.  Zainab Bawa suggested that tickets should cover at least 30% of conference costs, with sponsorship covering the rest, ideally reaching a 50/50 split. Rasagy Sharma proposed raising the starting price of the lowest-priced model and offering discounts for specific demographics, such as students and nonprofits. Poojil Tiwari suggested group discounts.
	•	**Ticket Discount Policies** – Zainab Bawa recommended minimizing discretionary discounts requiring manual approvals to streamline the process. Existing automated discounts for bulk purchases were noted. The group discussed student and diversity discounts, with Zainab Bawa proposing a sponsorship-based approach for diversity tickets and a separate application process for student tickets.
	•	**Student and Diversity Ticket Allocation** – Amit Kapoor questioned the feasibility of implementing separate pricing for students and early-career professionals due to logistical challenges in verification. Zainab Bawa suggested collaborating with university partners for bulk student ticket purchases. The group favored a simplified approach, prioritizing self-service options to minimize administrative burden. The group agreed that inclusivity for students was important but that logistical considerations regarding verification were a major factor.
	• **Nonprofit Ticket Discounts** – Discussion addressed nonprofit discounts. Poojil Tiwari suggested a case-by-case approach for nonprofit discounts, rather than a pre-set pricing model, to avoid the complexities associated with eligibility verification. Rasagy Sharma acknowledged this, highlighting the aim of avoiding manual judgment calls.
	•	**Bangalore Pre-Event** – Ipsa Jain provided an update on the Bangalore pre-event scheduled for April 25th, outlining the need to secure a venue (currently in discussion with Microsoft and Epic World) and identify a moderator. They also mentioned the importance of finalizing the volunteer form.
	•	**Production Coordination and Volunteer** – Recruitment Zainab Bawa highlighted the role of Nidhi in production coordination and mentioned the need to connect Nidhi with a point of contact for print materials. This role was ultimately assigned to Poojil Tiwari. Zainab Bawa further suggested incorporating icebreaker activities for future events, drawing on experience from a previous event.
