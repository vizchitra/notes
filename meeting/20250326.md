**Summary**
The meeting covered the success of the Hyderabad meetup (Zainab Bawa), feedback on the proposal jam (Swathi Singh and Amit Kapoor), Visitra conference planning including pricing (Zainab Bawa and Nithya Subramanian), branding and marketing updates (Rasagy Sharma and Divya Ribeiro), proposal management (Amit Kapoor, Rasagy Sharma, and Divya Ribeiro), event planning and volunteer recruitment (Ipsa Jain), diversity and inclusion initiatives (Rasagy Sharma), sales and sponsorship strategies (Amit Kapoor and Nithya Subramanian), and community management (Rasagy Sharma).  Next steps include implementing a more structured proposal jam, finalizing Visitra ticket pricing, continuing outreach for speakers and sponsors, developing a robust volunteer recruitment strategy, and addressing community management challenges.

**Outline**

- **Hyderabad Meetup Success**: Zainab Bawa reported a highly successful Hyderabad meetup, noting 160 attendees engaged with Anand's realistic, interactive presentation.  They highlighted the refreshing perspective and the significant opportunity for community expansion in Hyderabad.
- **Proposal Jam Feedback**: Swathi Singh described the proposal jam as a success in generating ideas, but suggested a more effective structure for future events, perhaps with earlier idea submission and focused feedback. Amit Kapoor added that the editorial team's ability to quickly establish a process and adapt to feedback was a major win. They also noted the challenge of maintaining consistent energy during hosting, suggesting that practice and experience are key to improvement.
- **VizChitra Conference Ticket Pricing**: A discussion on VizChitra conference ticket pricing ensued. Zainab Bawa suggested a transparent pricing model that balances cost recovery with sponsorship revenue, aiming for at least a 30% contribution from ticket sales to maintain neutrality. They emphasized the need for clear content signaling to attract corporate attendees and suggested modelling prices based on competitors like Analytics India Magazine. Nithya Subramanian indicated willingness to pay ₹3,000-5,000 depending on perceived value and upskilling opportunities.
~ **VizChitra Branding and Marketing**: Rasagy Sharma provided updates on branding initiatives, including new sticker and YouTube thumbnail designs. They also highlighted the importance of subscribing to the YouTube channel and reminded participants that core group members beyond the editorial team are welcome to propose talks and workshops (00:13:59).  Divya Ribeiro mentioned upcoming follow-ups with potential speakers.
- **VizChitra Proposal Management**: Amit Kapoor raised concerns about managing the influx of proposals, including those from the proposal jam. Rasagy Sharma and Divya Ribeiro discussed strategies for tracking and following up on proposals, emphasizing the need to distribute the workload among the editorial team. They also discussed the need to determine a target number of proposals to ensure enough talks and workshops.
- **VizChitra Events and Volunteers**: Ipsa Jain presented plans for two types of events: skill-sharing sessions ("Skill Barter") and project showcases ("Showcase"). They discussed the need for volunteers to support these events, emphasizing the importance of a clear volunteer recruitment strategy and collaboration with other teams.
- **VizChitra Diversity and Inclusion**: Rasagy Sharma raised the importance of diversity and inclusion in speaker selection, suggesting proactive outreach to underrepresented groups. They proposed using existing communication templates and offering assistance to potential speakers to facilitate proposal submission.
- **VizChitra Sales and Sponsorship**: Amit Kapoor discussed sales leads, emphasizing the need for increased outreach from the core team. They outlined a process for handling leads, with an initial cold outreach followed by a handoff to the sales team when the lead becomes warm.  Nithya Subramanian raised questions about the sales pipeline, and Amit Kapoor clarified the process and funding goals.
- **VizChitra Community Management**: Rasagy Sharma addressed the challenges of managing the large and growing community WhatsApp group, suggesting strategies for controlling membership, creating a second group, and defining success metrics for community engagement. They also noted the need to explore additional methods of outreach for leads.
