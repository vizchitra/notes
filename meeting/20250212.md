**Outline**

- **Community Growth and Engagement**: The Friends of Vishchitra WhatsApp group reached 200 members in two days, and Instagram and LinkedIn also showed significant growth.  Amit Kapoor emphasized the importance of actively engaging this diverse community, noting the interesting work being shared.  Gurman Bhatia highlighted the success of the Friends of Vishchitra group in connecting people with cool work. They identified attracting and retaining diverse members as key to the community's success.
- **Communications Strategy**: The team discussed strategies for improving communications. They decided to recruit Surbhi and Prakriti to assist with communications, and discussed the need for social media templates for different event formats. There was a consensus to combine collateral work under the communications stream.  The team also planned a launch party on Zoom on February 21st at 5 p.m. to introduce VizChitra to the community.  A key decision was to launch the call for proposals during the launch party. The team will also create a YouTube channel to record and share the event.
- **Branding and Visual Identity**:  The team reviewed branding efforts, including a deck template and individual logos (00:06:23). They discussed the creation of social media templates, a favicon for the website, and other branding materials .  Hamsa Ganesh suggested keeping communications and branding efforts separate to avoid confusion.
- **Sponsorships and Partnerships**: The team discussed securing sponsorships, focusing on Indian SaaS companies and tool companies like Adobe, Figma, PowerBI, and Tableau. They also considered media partnerships and discussed potential partnerships with educational institutions and non-profits.  A 10% discount was offered for sponsorships finalized before March 31st. The team acknowledged that securing sponsorships from VCs might be challenging due to the AI hype. Reaching out to VCs' partner companies was suggested as a potential alternative approach.  Revisual Labs became an official sponsor, providing five scholarships for the conference.
- **Website Development and Maintenance**: Amit Kapoor initiated the development of a website for VizChitra, using HTML and CSS.  They expressed a need for community involvement in the websiteâ€™s maintenance and content creation. The team discussed the need for a clear flow of communication between the website and other channels like WhatsApp, and considered integrating a conference page or linking directly to the existing conference page (00:59:16).  Gurman Bhatia suggested incorporating a CSS animation of the logo into the website.
- **Community Management and Structure**:  The team recognized a need for a dedicated community management stream to better engage with the growing Friends of Vishchitra community. They considered separating the Friends of VizChitra group from other Vishchitra groups on WhatsApp to improve organization and manage the influx of new members. They explored options for adding more admins to workstream groups and setting membership request approval. A process for adding and removing core members based on activity was discussed. They also discussed the need for clear guidelines on core group membership and participation to manage expectations and inclusion. A discussion of the role expectations for core group members and editorial group members revealed a need for clarifying the roles and responsibilities of members within the core group.  The team also noted the need for broader representation in the core group and editorial streams to ensure inclusivity of various perspectives.
- **Website Calendar and Event Promotion**: The team discussed the creation of an event calendar on the VisChitra website. Initial suggestions included listing launch parties and town halls, but Rasagy Sharma proposed leveraging existing HasGeek event infrastructure to avoid redundant effort. The team ultimately agreed to link to the HasGeek community page for events, rather than replicating the calendar on the Viscetra website. This decision was driven by a desire to avoid duplicated work and to utilize existing resources.
- **Website Content and Sponsorship**: The team also discussed the website's content, focusing on providing information about VisChitra, including how to join and information on events. They addressed the need to showcase sponsors, noting that the Haskell Geek website already includes sponsor logos, making that aspect sufficient.  Amit Kapoor will collaborate with Urmila, Aman and Schubert to establish a process for future website updates and maintenance.
- **Upcoming Events and Action Items**: The team reviewed upcoming events, including a town hall on February 21st at 5:00 PM. Poojil Tiwari will coordinate the setup of the event page on haskell.com, including registration and Zoom details.  The team also planned to promote the conference at the launch party and integrate related content into the calendar.  The overall focus will be on the February 21st town hall, followed by continued work on the community's long-term vision.
