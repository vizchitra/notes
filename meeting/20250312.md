**Summary**

The team collaborated on conference preparations, focusing on talk proposal guidelines, format clarification, curation, and community outreach.  Amit Kapoor will lead CFP page creation and website updates, while Gurman Bhatia will assist with community outreach;  further, Amit Kapoor will present on talk formats at the pre-event.

**Outline**

- **Break Times**: Zainab Bawa requested that the scheduled break times of 45 minutes, 45 minutes, and 1.5 hours be maintained to accommodate sponsors and attendees with varying needs. Rasagy Sharma agreed that this made sense.
- **Talk Proposal Guidelines**: Rasagy Sharma suggested providing examples of good talk proposals to assist those preparing submissions. Zainab Bawa offered to share examples and answer questions. They also noted that having guidelines would help people understand the differences between talk formats, such as standard and lightning talks.
- **Talk Proposal Deck**: Rasagy Sharma and Amit Kapoor discussed creating a slide deck outlining different talk formats (standard, lightning, workshop, performance). Amit Kapoor will share the existing deck and they will work together to adapt it.  The goal is to clarify the differences between talk formats, to make the differences clear for submitters.
- **Talk Length and Curation**: Zainab Bawa emphasized the importance of talk curation through rehearsals to ensure appropriate length and quality.  They explained that while most submitters will propose 30-minute talks, rehearsals allow for adjustments to optimize talk length for better presentation and prestige. Rasagy Sharma suggested providing additional context to the editorial team to facilitate better communication about talk length.
- **Examples for Talk Proposals**: Gurman Bhatia suggested including examples of successful talks from past events to inspire and guide potential speakers. Amit Kapoor mentioned existing examples, but noted they might need updating to reflect current best practices. Rasagy Sharma suggested focusing on the differences between talk formats as the lowest hanging fruit for the deck.
- **Pre-event Presentation**: Rasagy Sharma proposed that Amit Kapoor give a 5-10 minute presentation at the pre-event, using the updated slide deck to showcase different talk formats. Amit Kapoor agreed to do so, but noted that they may simplify the types of talks to avoid confusion.
- **CFP Page Creation**: Zainab Bawa suggested that Amit Kapoor take the lead on creating the CFP page, emphasizing that this task cannot be done asynchronously. They noted that a template exists, and Rasagy Sharma can assist by adding details regarding the event's activities and participants.
- **Community Outreach**: Amit Kapoor summarized three communication points: simultaneous posting across multiple platforms, creating a short video for the launch party, and expanding outreach to more communities. Gurman Bhatia offered to help with outreach to Indian Pixels and other communities. They also discussed the creation of templates and clear calls to action to guide the outreach effort.
- **HasGeek Page Usability**: Surbhi Bhatia and Amit Kapoor discussed the usability of the HasGeek submissions page, noting its lack of user-friendliness. Amit Kapoor plans to submit a feature request to improve its design. The goal is to make the call for proposals more visible and easier to understand for submitters.
- **Poll Data Sharing: Surbhi Bhatia suggested a community activity involving the release of poll data for community analysis and visualization. Amit Kapoor noted that a data repository already exists, and they will update it regularly with the poll data and share it responsibly.
- **Community Engagement Frequency**: Ipsa Jain raised concerns about the frequency of community engagement on WhatsApp. Surbhi Bhatia and Prakriti Bakshi suggested maintaining daily engagement until the conference, then potentially adjusting frequency based on community feedback. Rasagy Sharma suggested directing high-frequency users to the low-frequency announcements channel.
- **Branding and Website Updates**: Amit Kapoor discussed objectives for the web team, including finalizing branding by April 15th and launching website updates by May 15th. They also discussed coordinating with Rasagy Sharma to ensure efficient communication and collaboration. Schubert mentioned planning for adding new website sections and archiving content for future use.
