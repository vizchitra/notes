**Summary**
The VizChitra launch in Bangalore was successful, resulting in an active 800-person community with subgroups and freelance work opportunities;  Ipsa and Rasagy joined the admin team to manage the growing community, and Poojil Tiwari presented a comprehensive communications plan across five channels.  Next steps include finalizing the budget, completing the Hazgeek contract, and releasing the CFP by mid-week with a deadline of April 15th.

**Outline**
- **VizChitra Launch and Community Growth**: The VizChitra launch in Bangalore was successful, reaching a community of 800 people, and generating interest from companies.  The community is flourishing, with the formation of sub-communities and positive interactions.  One participant even secured freelance work through the Vizitra group.  The WhatsApp community is particularly active and engaging.  A decision was made to separate the community stream from the communications stream to improve organization and moderation as the community grows.
- **Admin and Meta Group Updates**: Two new admins, Ipsa and Ranga, were added to the admin and meta group to assist with the growing community and sub-groups.  Their role will focus on guiding sub-communities and offering support where needed.  The budget is solidifying, and ticket prices should be available at the next meeting.  The contract with Hazgeek is nearing completion.
- **Communications Plan**: Poojil Tiwari presented a communications plan outlining strategies for five channels: social media, website, HasGeek, YouTube, and WhatsApp/community channels/events.  Goals vary by channel, with social media focusing on brand awareness and visual representation, the website on credibility, and the WhatsApp community on direct engagement and conversions.  They aim to create a repository of templates for various content needs, and are seeking a video editor.  A plan for a structured request pipeline was also discussed.
- **Events Planning**: Ipsa Jain outlined plans for three to four online events facilitated by members of the Friends of VizChitra group, focusing on skill-sharing and showcasing work.  At least one in-person event is planned in Bangalore, possibly with an additional city.  Discussions are planned with the editorial team to avoid overlap between pre-events and the conference.  Different models for organizing future events were explored, including the TED/TEDx model and a local chapters model.
- **Call for Proposals (CFP) and Sponsored Talks**:  The CFP is planned for release midweek of the following week, with a closing date of April 15th.  The editorial team plans to curate an email to encourage submissions.  The group discussed sponsored talks and panels, deciding to limit the number and ensure they align with the conference's overall theme.  The ideal approach is to integrate sponsored content seamlessly rather than relegating it to less-attended parallel sessions.  They'll continue to discuss the number and placement of sponsored content at a future admin meeting.
- **Sponsorships and Outreach**:  The group discussed strategies for securing sponsorships, particularly focusing on tools and visualization companies.  They emphasized the importance of word-of-mouth referrals and shared ideas on how to make outreach efforts more effective.  The group will share an outreach email template to facilitate this.
